# Hey there, I'm Mustafa Kursun 👋

I'm a self-taught developer (with some experience in project management) who enjoys wearing many hats. With 3 years of coding and a year running IT projects, I bring a fresh, practical perspective to tech—rooted in real-world experience and curiosity.

## 🚀 What I'm About

- **Generalist Mindset:**  
  I’ve dabbled in almost every step of the SDLC, connecting the dots between code, people, and process.

- **Back-end Dev Experience:**  
  - Kept a legacy insurance web system running (and improving) for an online insurance broker.
  - Helped migrate that system to a new microservice architecture.
  - Built integrations with all sorts of third-party services.
  - Crafted both backend and frontend features for insurance businesses across two countries—adapting to users’ needs wherever they are.

- **Project Management:**  
  - Made the jump to PM to create more impact at a global scale.
  - Led teams, communicated across cultures, and always pushed for cleaner, more efficient delivery.
  - Took time out for a big life move—relocating and learning a new language along the way.

## 🌱 What I'm Doing Nowadays

As a self-taught dev, I realized there were gaps in my engineering know-how. So these days, I’m digging into:
- Accessible web and performance fundamentals
- Best practices in user interface development
- Web protocols and APIs (REST, etc.)
- The core principles of efficient, high-performing web development

If you geek out about any of these, let’s chat!
